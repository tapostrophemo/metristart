MetriStart.com - Metrics For Your Startup

Overview: to validate your Customer Discovery hypothesis, you'll need to
track the following metrics:

  * Customer acquisition cost
  * Viral coefficient
  * Customer dlfetime value
  * Average selling price/order size
  * Monthly burn rate
  * etc.

These are not the same set of metrics you'd use to to track an established
business - an Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement.
