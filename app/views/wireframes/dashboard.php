<p>The following is a sample of what the "dashboard" page might look like:</p>

<table border="0" width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

 <tr>
  <th>Customer Acquisition</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><pre class="rounded">
    * Cost Per Acquisition Paid
    * Cost Per Acquisition Net
    * Advertising Expenses
    * Viral Acquisition Ratio</pre>
  </td>
 </tr>

</table>
